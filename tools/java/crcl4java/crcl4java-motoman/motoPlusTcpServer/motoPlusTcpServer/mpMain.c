/*********************************
This software provides the server side to be paired with 
the client side library in Java named crcl4java-motoman.


NOTE: To run on motoman requires:
MotoPlus SDK for Visual Studion(FS100) 169272.3 v1.1.0

This requires a USB dongle.

On Windows 7 compiling requires one to  first set
EnableLUA to 0
in
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System
with regedit.exe

To INSTALL after compiling:

Copy   motoPlusTcpServer.out from motoPlusTcpServer\FS100\motoPlusTcpServer subdirectory
to a USB stick.

From C:\Users\Public\Documents\YaskawaMotomanDocumentation\MotoPlus_SDK_For_Visual_Studio
read 169286-1CD.pdf  
(aka "MOTOPLUS SDK FOR VISUAL STUDIO USER’S MANUAL")

Insert the USB stick in the back of Motoman pendant.
Reboot into maintenance mode by holding main menu during bootup and choosing special mode when offered.
Use System -> Security -> Mode -> Management Mode
Default password is 99999999

MotoPlus APL. -> Load (User Application) -> select motoPlusTcpServer.out
press Enter -> YES -> (Overwrite file?) YES

Reboot.


Running in simulation on a any regular PC
can be done without Motoman software with mpFakeLib.
